# Graph Tutorial

### Types of graphs

*   Undirected graphs: The edges between any two vertices in an “undirected graph” do not have a direction, indicating a two-way relationship.
*   Directed graphs: The edges between any two vertices in a “directed graph” graph are directional.
*   Weighted graphs: Each edge in a “weighted graph” has an associated weight. The weight can be of any metric, such as time, distance, size, etc. The most commonly seen “weighted map” in our daily life might be a city map. 

### Terminologies

*   Vertex: nodes such as A, B, and C are called vertices of the graph.

*   Edge: The connection between two vertices are the edges of the graph.

*   Path: the sequence of vertices to go through from one vertex to another. 
    *   **Note**: there can be multiple paths between two vertices.

*   Path Length: the number of edges in a path. 

*   Cycle: a path where the starting point and endpoint are the same vertexes. 

*   Negative Weight Cycle: In a “weighted graph”, if the sum of the weights of all edges of a cycle is a negative value, it is a negative weight cycle. 

*   Connectivity: if there exists at least one path between two vertices, these two vertices are connected. 

*   Degree of a Vertex: the term “degree” applies to unweighted graphs. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connecting the vertex. 

*   In-Degree: “in-degree” is a concept in directed graphs. 

*   Out-Degree: “out-degree” is a concept in directed graphs.
