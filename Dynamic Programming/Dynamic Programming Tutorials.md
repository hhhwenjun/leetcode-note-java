# Dynamic Programming Tutorials

## Definition

*   **Dynamic Programming** (DP) is a programming paradigm that can systematically and efficiently explore all possible solutions to a problem.
    *   The problem can be broken down into "overlapping subproblems" - smaller versions of the original problem that are re-used multiple times.
    *   The problem has an "optimal substructure" - an optimal solution can be formed from optimal solutions to the overlapping subproblems of the original problem.
